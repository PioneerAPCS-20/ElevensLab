# Elevens Lab

The Elevens lab is the third of the three (current) AP Computer Science labs we will be completing.

Major topics in this lab include use of (abstract) classes, interfaces, inheritance, and `List`s / `ArrayList`s.

We will be using the AP Lab guide which includes directions for adding to the pre-existing code and questions for you to answer. You will upload your .java files for each activity as usual and put your answers to the questions as a comment at the top of one of the files.
